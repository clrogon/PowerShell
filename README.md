# PowerShell Scripts Repository
## Description
Welcome to the PowerShell Scripts Repository. This repository is a collection of scripts that assist me in my daily tasks as a System Administrator. Each script is designed to automate or simplify a particular task, making my work more efficient and less prone to errors.
## Scripts
Here are the scripts currently in this repository:
### 1. Reboot Reminder
RebootReminder.ps1 is a PowerShell script designed to remind users to reboot their system if it hasn't been rebooted within a specified number of days. The script sends a balloon notification to the user, and if the system isn't rebooted within a specified timeframe, it enforces a system reboot. [Read more here](RebootReminder/README.md).
### 2. Show Balloon Tips
ShowBalloonTips.ps1 is a PowerShell script designed to display balloon tips to the user. This script can be used to show notifications, alerts, or reminders to the user. Read more here (replace with the actual path to the README file of this script).
## Usage
Each script can be used individually according to your needs. You can find specific instructions on how to use each script in their respective README files.
