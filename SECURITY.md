# Security Policy

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this PowerShell repository and provides guidance for contributors and users.

## Security Overview

This repository contains PowerShell scripts designed for system administration tasks. Security is a top priority, and all scripts have undergone comprehensive security auditing and remediation.

## Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **Credential Management**: Proper use of PSCredential objects
- ✅ **Administrative Privilege Checks**: Verification of admin rights before critical operations
- ✅ **Network Authentication**: Optional credential support for network operations

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Path Traversal Protection**: All file paths validated for directory traversal attacks
- ✅ **WMI/CIM Injection Prevention**: Sanitized queries using proper parameterization
- ✅ **XML Injection Prevention**: XML entity escaping for all user inputs
- ✅ **Registry Injection Protection**: Alphanumeric-only validation for registry operations
- ✅ **Command Injection Prevention**: Blocking dangerous command patterns

### Cryptography
- ✅ **Strong Hash Algorithms**: Default to SHA256 (or stronger) instead of deprecated MD5
- ✅ **Hash Algorithm Validation**: Restricted to approved secure algorithms

### Privacy Protection
- ✅ **Optional User Logging**: Username logging made opt-in for privacy
- ✅ **No Personal Data**: Removed hardcoded personal information

### Network Security
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: All downloads validated for HTTPS protocol
- ✅ **URL Validation**: Comprehensive format and protocol validation
- ✅ **Secure Remote Execution**: Proper credential handling for remote operations

### Error Handling
- ✅ **Active Security Checks**: All security validations enabled (no commented exits)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events logged for audit trails
- ✅ **Graceful Failure**: Secure behavior on validation failures

## Security Guidelines for Users

### Before Using Scripts

1. **Test in Non-Production Environment**: Always test scripts in a controlled environment before production use
2. **Review Code**: Understand what each script does before execution
3. **Verify Source**: Only download scripts from trusted sources
4. **Use Digital Signatures**: Verify script integrity using digital signatures when available

### Best Practices

1. **Run with Minimum Privileges**: Only use administrative privileges when necessary
2. **Secure Credentials**: Use PSCredential objects instead of plain text
3. **Enable Logging**: Keep logs for security auditing
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep scripts updated with security patches
5. **Backup Data**: Always backup before running scripts that modify systems

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

### Code Submission Requirements

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
2. **Path Safety**: Prevent path traversal attacks
3. **Secure Defaults**: Use secure algorithms and settings by default
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
5. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit passwords, API keys, or personal information

### Security Review Checklist

- [ ] Input validation for all user-provided data
- [ ] Path traversal protection for file operations
- [ ] Injection prevention (SQL, WMI, XML, command)
- [ ] Proper credential handling
- [ ] Strong cryptographic algorithms
- [ ] Privacy-conscious logging
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement for network operations
- [ ] Error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Administrative privilege checks
- [ ] Documentation of security considerations

### Prohibited Patterns

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Never commit passwords or API keys
2. **Weak Cryptography**: Avoid MD5, SHA1, or other deprecated algorithms
3. **Disabled Security Checks**: Never comment out security validations
4. **Unvalidated Inputs**: Always sanitize user input
5. **Path Traversal**: Prevent `..` sequences in paths
6. **Injection-Prone Operations**: Avoid string concatenation in queries
7. **Information Disclosure**: Don't log sensitive data

## Reporting Security Issues

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO** send an email to the repository maintainer
3. **DO** provide detailed information:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### Security Issue Handling

1. **Acknowledge**: You will receive a response within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: The issue will be evaluated for severity and impact
3. **Fix Development**: A fix will be developed and tested
4. **Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, the issue may be publicly disclosed with attribution (if requested)

## Security Audit History

### Initial Security Audit (January 2026)
**Comprehensive audit performed covering:**
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization
- Cryptographic implementations
- Input validation
- Privacy and data protection
- Network security
- Error handling

**Remediation completed for:**
- All critical vulnerabilities (5 issues)
- All high-priority issues (3 issues)
- All medium-priority issues (5 issues)

**Status:** ✅ All security issues resolved

## Digital Signatures

### Recommended Practice
All PowerShell scripts should be digitally signed before use in production environments. Digital signing ensures:

- **Authenticity**: Verification of the script's source
- **Integrity**: Confirmation that the script hasn't been modified
- **Trust**: Control over which scripts can be executed

### How to Sign Scripts

```powershell
# Obtain a code signing certificate from a trusted CA
# Sign a script
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "YourScript.ps1" -Certificate $cert

# Verify a signature
Get-AuthenticodeSignature "YourScript.ps1"
```

### Execution Policy

Configure PowerShell execution policy to require signed scripts:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```

## Compliance and Standards

This repository follows industry best practices:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against web application vulnerabilities
